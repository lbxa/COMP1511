~~ The Mechanical Turk Task due today ~~


List below - in the planned order you will implement them (first at the top) - your ideas for how you will make your mechanical turk behave.  
Give brief reasons why you think each feature is important, and why you have chosen to implement them in this order.

1.  Mr Pass - starts spinoff if has resources, otherwise passes.  Why first? This is required to be the first Turk everyone submits.
2.  
3.  
4.  
â€¦

 - Finds and places best campus spot depending on resources
 - Places ARC grants?
 - etc..
 
 then put this ^^ stuff in number order

Write below the plan you and your Turk Pair partner have devised to ensure you will be an effective team:

We will ...
1) Make sure to keep in contact either through a messaging service or Cloud9
2) Keep up to date with the new strategies to be implemented
3) Keep the code nice and clean with good artisanship principles
